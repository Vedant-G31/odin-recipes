                <h4 class="title">Steps</h4>
                <h4><em>Dough</em></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a large wide bowl if you are doing it by hand and a spatula.</li>
                    <li>If not, you can also use a Kitchen-Aid mixer if you have one.</li>
                    <li>In the bowl, put in 3 cups of flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Mix them well.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the warm water and mix it until unified. Add olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add in the remaining flour as you mix it. You might need more if it gets sticky.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough in the bowl until a smooth ball is formed. </li>
                    <li>Place the dough ball in a clean bowl greased with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Cover it and let it rise for 3 hours or overnight if you are feeling very patient.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4><em>Sauce</em></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>For one pizza, take 1/4 cup of Sans Marzano tomatoes or pureed tomatoes in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle a little bit of olive oil. </li>
                    <li>Add in the finely chopped garlic.</li>
                    <li>Add in the basil.</li>
                    <li>Add in the pepper flakes if you like.</li>
                    <li>Add salt for taste.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4><em>Pizzas...Assemble!</em></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 415F.</li>
                    <li>Split the dough into 4 even pizza dough balls.</li>
                    <li>Prepare your toppings of your choice.</li>
                    <li>You can prepare the pizza using a pizza pan. Or if you have a pizza stone/steel, place it in the
                        oven while it preheats.</li>
                    <li>If you are using a pizza pan, make sure to grease it with olive oil. </li>
                    <li>Take the dough ball and press it downwards to shape it into a thick disc. </li>
                    <li>At this point, you can use a rolling pin to stretch it into a pizza base. Or you can stretch it
                        by hand.</li>
                    <li>Once your pizza base is nice and stretched out, you can start spreading the sauce. Slowly and
                        one scoop at the time.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle some parmesan over the sauce. It gives it that extra punch.</li>
                    <li>Then sprinkle some mozzarella cheese near the crust towards the center of the pizza. Add
                        whatever amount of cheese you like.</li>
                    <li>Add your toppings.</li>
                    <li>Once you are happy with the pie you assembled, place it in the oven. Bake it for about 15 mins
                        or until crust is golden brown.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> In this stage, you can pretty much do whatever you want with your pizza. Have
                    fun!</p>
